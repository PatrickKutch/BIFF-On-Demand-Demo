# Demo for OnDemand Tabs and Grids

For some upcoming projects at work I need more 'dynamic' capabilities.  As such I've added the ability to set Namesapce, ID triggers that will dynamically create new Tabs and Grids.

To use, grab this repository, and the BIFF tool itself from https://github.com/intel/Board-Instrumentation-Framework.  Place the OnDemand-Demo directory in this repository into the place where you have compiled Marvin.  Run Marvin, using the OnDemand-Demo\OnDemand-DemoApplication.xml configuation file.  Then go and run Oscar and load the OnDemandDemo.biff save file.

You will see new tabs appear as the data runs.  The new tabs will appear at about every 10 seconds during the beginning of the playback.

The XML files for the application have tons of comments within to explain the new features.
